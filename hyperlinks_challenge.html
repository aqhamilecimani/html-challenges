    <h4><em>Why coding?</em></h4>
    <p>I was exposed to coding and developing by my friends that are already developers and working for major companies. We decided to start a multimedia company that included making websites for clients and graphic designs. In the business, I was the only one doing administrative work and not the developing part cause I was not experienced in it and no knowledge of it. The work load was becoming to much for them and I would feel like I could help. I started asking to do minor work in developing and then I saw how much I enjoyed, I started reading on the internet about coding and that helped me into having a conversation with developers and the passion grew from that.</p>
    <h4><em>Creative mind</em></h4>
    <p>I came to the coding course with an idea in my mind of an app that I can develop. I thought of selling the idea to my friends but then I realised that there is nothing stopping me from developing the app myself.Having a creative mind and always thinking will help you in becoming the best developer.I always thought that the coding is difficult and cannot be done. What most important is that, to be a developer or coder, you must be passionate and be enthusiastic. Be a creative person, problem –solver, be determined and practise, practise, practise. I have realised that I am all I mentioned above,and more during the coding course.</p>
    <h4><em><a href="http://www.lifechoices.co.za/">Life Choices Academy</a><a href="http://codespace.co.za/courses/web-academy/">Codespace</a></em></h4>
      <p>The journey into coding started when I applied for system development programme and after that the passion grew. I came across life choices academy in partnership when I was searching for a coding school and I applied to it. With minimum, close to no knowledge at all, I made it to the twho weeks bootcamp and finally made it to the 6 months coding course that is followed by a 6 months internship in companies working with life choices and codespace. When I started with the coding course I thought it was going to be difficult, but with all the resources, lecturers, code coaches and classmates it is an exciting learning environment to be in.</p>
      <h4><em>What I've learned so far.</em></h4>
      <p>I am an competent HTML and more! So far I have learned a lot and from what I have learned and what we have covered I can create my own webpage.in that webpage I can also insert a graphic(e.g includes images , making an image as a link and also embed a video). For websites that have tables, I can also insert a table, also nesting and manipulating the tables(this all means having a table inside a table) smart, hey? A webpage can have different heading from BIG AND BOLD to small and italic. Ever wondered how the receipt from a website can be so ordered in a list? Well I can do that. Heey! That is called lists, and it can either be an ordered list or unordered list. And those Survey! That we see on website and wondered how that came about. Well it’s a called a form and that can also be validated , meaning those little restriction messages that tells you when you have not entered the write text or format.
      I know all that! It sounds exciting, right? Well that’s what coding is,EXCITING!
     </p>
     <h4><em>Pursue</em></h4>
     <p>I pursued my dreams of becoming a web developer and I advice each and everyone to pursue their dream career.Be coding,system development, being a chef or anything you want to be as long as you have passion for it and its something you like to do.Do what you love and never work a day in your life!</p>
